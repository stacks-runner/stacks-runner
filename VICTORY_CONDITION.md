# Victory Condition Implementation - Level 10 Completion

## Feature Added âœ…

### **Victory Condition at Level 10**
When the player successfully collects the main orange STX token on Level 10, instead of advancing to Level 11, the game ends with a spectacular victory celebration.

## Implementation Details âœ…

### **1. Modified collectMainSTX() Method**
```javascript
// Check if player completed final level (Level 10)
if (this.gameState.level >= 10) {
    console.log('ðŸŽ‰ GAME WON! Player completed all levels!');
    this.gameWon();
    return;
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added level check before advancing to next level
- Triggers `gameWon()` instead of `generateNewLevel()` when level â‰¥ 10
- Prevents progression beyond Level 10

### **2. New gameWon() Method**
```javascript
gameWon() {
    this.gameState.isGameOver = true;
    // Stop timer
    if (this.gameTimer) {
        this.gameTimer.destroy();
    }
    // Show victory screen
    this.showVictoryScreen();
    // Submit score to blockchain
    this.submitScore();
}
```

**Functionality:**
- Sets game over state
- Stops the countdown timer
- Shows congratulatory victory screen
- Submits final score to blockchain

### **3. Spectacular Victory Screen**
Created `showVictoryScreen()` method with:

**Visual Elements:**
- **Gradient background** with neon blue and orange colors
- **Animated title** with pulsing "ðŸŽ‰ VICTORY! ðŸŽ‰" text
- **Congratulatory message** acknowledging the achievement
- **Final score display** prominently featured
- **Achievement description** highlighting the progression from 20Ã—20 to 40Ã—40 mazes
- **Play Again button** with hover effects

**CSS Animations:**
- `victoryFadeIn` - Dramatic entrance animation
- `victoryPulse` - Continuous pulsing title effect
- Button hover animations with scaling and glow effects

### **4. Updated Game Flow**
**Before:** Level 10 â†’ Level 11 (would break/error)
**After:** Level 10 â†’ Victory Screen â†’ Option to restart

### **5. Enhanced Restart Functionality**
Updated `restartGame()` to handle both scenarios:
- Hide game over screen (for deaths/timeouts)
- Hide victory screen (for completed games)
- Reset to Level 1 with fresh game state

### **6. Score Submission Integration**
Updated `submitScore()` to work with both screens:
- Uses victory submission status element when available
- Falls back to game over submission status
- Maintains blockchain integration for leaderboards
