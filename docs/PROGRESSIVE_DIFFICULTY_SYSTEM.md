# Progressive Difficulty System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a 10-level progressive difficulty system where maze complexity and size scale from simple (Level 1) to complex (Level 10).

## Changes Made

### 1. MazeGenerator Enhancement
**Files Updated:**
- `frontend/public/src/utils/mazeGenerator.js`
- `frontend/src/utils/mazeGenerator.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `removeWallsRatio` parameter to constructor (default: 0)
- Implemented `removeAdditionalWalls(ratio)` method to simplify mazes
- Added `getNeighborInDirection(cell, direction)` helper method
- Modified `generate()` to call wall removal for simpler mazes

**How it Works:**
- Higher `removeWallsRatio` = More walls removed = Simpler maze
- Ratio 0.4 = 40% of cells have additional walls removed
- Ratio 0.0 = No additional walls removed = Maximum complexity

### 2. GameScene Progressive Difficulty
**Files Updated:**
- `frontend/public/src/scenes/GameScene.js`
- `frontend/src/scenes/GameScene.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `getMazeConfigForLevel(level)` method
- Updated `generateNewLevel()` to use progressive maze configuration
- Dynamic maze offset calculation for variable maze sizes

**Difficulty Progression:**

| Level | Maze Size | Complexity    | Wall Removal | Description |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1     | 8×8       | Very Easy     | 40%          | Wide paths, easy navigation |
| 2     | 9×9       | Easy          | 35%          | Still simple |
| 3     | 10×10     | Easy-Medium   | 30%          | Getting trickier |
| 4     | 11×11     | Medium        | 25%          | Moderate challenge |
| 5     | 12×12     | Medium        | 20%          | Balanced difficulty |
| 6     | 13×13     | Medium-Hard   | 15%          | More complex paths |
| 7     | 14×14     | Hard          | 10%          | Difficult navigation |
| 8     | 14×14     | Hard          | 5%           | Very challenging |
| 9     | 14×14     | Very Hard     | 2%           | Near-maximum complexity |
| 10    | 15×15     | Expert        | 0%           | Maximum complexity |

## Benefits

✅ **Learning Curve**: Players can master controls on easy levels
✅ **Smooth Progression**: Gradual increase in difficulty
✅ **Player Retention**: Less frustration for new players
✅ **Rewarding Experience**: Sense of achievement as levels get harder
✅ **Preserved Challenge**: Level 10 maintains original difficulty

## Technical Details

### Maze Size Scaling
- Linear progression from 8×8 to 15×15
- Formula: `minSize + (maxSize - minSize) * ((level - 1) / 9)`

### Wall Removal Algorithm
1. After standard maze generation (recursive backtracking)
2. Calculate walls to remove: `totalCells * removeWallsRatio`
3. Randomly select cells and remove random walls
4. Creates more open paths and shortcuts

### Dynamic Centering
- Maze offset recalculated each level based on new dimensions
- Ensures maze stays centered regardless of size
- Accounts for UI space at top

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Level 1**: Should be very easy, wide paths
2. **Level 5**: Should feel balanced, moderate challenge
3. **Level 10**: Should match previous "hard" difficulty
4. **Progression**: Each level should feel slightly harder than previous

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add difficulty presets (Easy/Normal/Hard mode)
- Allow players to choose starting level
- Implement maze generation algorithms for variety
- Add power-ups for higher levels
- Increase enemy/obstacle count with level
